## 1. General information 

### 1.1 Use of the Licensed Material

Siemens AG and/or a subsidiary of Siemens AG ("Siemens") provides You royalty-free container images, application examples, documentation, sample code and software development kits ("Licensed Material") through sharing platforms (e.g. GitHub, DockerHub, NuGet, etc.). The Licensed Material shall only be used for the development and test of software which can be used with Siemens products ("intended purpose"). The Licensed Material is non-binding and makes no claim to completeness or functionality. The Licensed Material merely offers help with typical tasks and provides an environment for developing and testing applications and other software. You Yourself are responsible for the proper and safe operation of Your products in accordance with applicable regulations and must also check the function of the results of the Licensed Material and customize Your products. Siemens reserves the right to make changes to the Licensed Material at any time without notice. Software may be provided in object code and/or source code format.

### 1.2 Security information

Siemens provides products and solutions with industrial security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks.

In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is necessary to implement – and continuously maintain – a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens' products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept.

Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) are in place.

For additional information on industrial security measures that may be implemented, please visit https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.

Siemens shall not be obligated to fulfill its obligation under section 2 if such fulfillment is prevented by any impediments arising out of national or international foreign trade or customs requirements or any embargoes or other sanctions.
