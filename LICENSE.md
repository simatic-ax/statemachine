**1. General information: Software in source code and object code**

**1.1 Use of the Software**

Siemens AG and/or a subsidiary of Siemens AG ("Siemens") provides You royalty-free container images, application examples, sample code and software development kits ("Software") through sharing platforms (e.g. GitHub, DockerHub, NuGet, etc.). The Software shall only be used for the development and test of software which can be used with Siemens products ("intended purpose"). The Software is non-binding and makes no claim to completeness or functionality. The Software merely offers help with typical tasks and provides an environment for developing and testing applications and other software. You Yourself are responsible for the proper and safe operation of Your products in accordance with applicable regulations and must also check the function of the results of the Software and customize Your products. Siemens reserves the right to make changes to the Software at any time without notice. Software may be provided in object code and/or source code format. Unless explicitly granted in the open source license according to article 2, You shall not decompile, translate, extract, modify or distribute the Software.

**1.2 Security information**

Siemens provides products and solutions with industrial security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks.

In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is necessary to implement – and continuously maintain – a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens' products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept.
Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) are in place.
